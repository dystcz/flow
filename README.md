## ðŸš§ Currently under heavy construction

Undergoing massive [slimming process](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/issues/4) and [quality of life](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/issues/2) improvements. Some may be [overkill](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/issues/5), others sound [reasonable](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/issues/3), but will be [hard](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/issues/6) nonetheless. Any help would be greatly appreciated, so we can get [here](https://github.com/dystcz/flow/milestone/1) at some point. ðŸ¥²

## Introduction

Are you sick of inconsistently reimplementing related business processes for your clients?

Do you want to find a common solution which is easy to build and maintain?

Look no more.

This package aims to ease your pain when implementing related business processes / workflows in Laravel.
Right now it uses [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) structure for flow relations.

## General idea


### Example flows

- Client project lifecycle (proposal, contract, deposit, development, feedback, ...)
- Multipart forms of any sorts
- Basically any process which can be split into smaller, logical pieces
